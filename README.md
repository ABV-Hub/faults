#### Fun with faults ####
A Jupyter notebook with preliminary workflow to segment faults from dip calculated on a seismic horizon.

#### Multiple synthetic seismic models with vertical fault ####
A Jupyter notebook whereby I take Agile Scientific's [x lines of code, Wedge model](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/xlines/blob/master/notebooks/00_Synthetic_wedge_model.ipynb) and adapt it to make 100 synthetic models: 10 impedance models x 10 wavelets x 10 random noise fields + 1 fault

#### Multiple synthetic seismic models with oblique fault ####
An extension of the above - in development

#### Demonstrate colormap distortions interactive Panel ####
A Panel app to demonstrate the effect of colormaps on perception and on the ability to see fault edges on a seismic section

#### Demonstrate colormap distortions ####
A static version of the above one
